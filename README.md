### The Problem statement
In India, women face significant challenges in finding the right skincare products suited to their unique skin types and concerns. With diverse skin tones, climatic conditions, and a vast range of available products, making an informed choice becomes overwhelming. Many women struggle with identifying products that work for their specific skin concerns‚Äîsuch as acne, pigmentation, dryness, or sensitivity‚Äîleading to trial-and-error purchases that waste time and money. Additionally, a lack of personalized guidance and misleading product claims further complicate the decision-making process.


### The Solution
To address the challenge of selecting the right skincare products based on individual skin types and concerns, we developed a web-based skincare recommendation application BLOOM to analyze user inputs, such as skin type, concerns (e.g., acne, dryness, sensitivity), and preferences.
